<h1>C++ Primer Plus 5th Edition</h1>
<h2>By: Stephen Prata</h2>

<h3>If, for whatever reason, you have a 20yr-old C++ textbook laying around and want a reference for the Review Questions and Programming
Exercises, find them contained within this repo.</h3>

<h3>Keep in mind these solutions are generated by myself, such that answers are not an exact match to the solutions contained within the textbook.</h3>

<h3>I do like to grade myself, so my Review Question answers do contain my first-pass answers, as well as whether they were correct or not.</h3>


<h4>Feel free to create a PR if for whatever reason you happen to be reviewing through this old textbook like me.</h4>
